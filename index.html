    <p>Hi, I'm Bratish Dasgupta, a passionate and driven software developer dedicated to building efficient, user-friendly, and impactful digital solutions. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive software.My journey in tech began with curiosity and evolved into a deep interest in full-stack development, data structures & algorithms, and software project management. I take pride in writing clean, scalable code and continuously improving my skills through hands-on projects and real-world problem solving.Over time, I’ve worked on several meaningful projects—ranging from dynamic web applications to system-level utilities—that reflect both my technical ability and commitment to continuous learning.When I’m not coding, you’ll find me working out at the gym, exploring the latest in tech, or learning something new that broadens my perspective.I’m currently seeking exciting opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and help build software that makes a difference.</p>
    <p>Let’s connect and create something great together!</p>
